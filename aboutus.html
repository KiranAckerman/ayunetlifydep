                Ayu Devices is serving both B2B customers such as telemedicine
                centers and B2C clients such as medical students, physicians,
                and cardiac surgeons. The startup is focusing on both rural
                healthcare centers and urban hospitals. We believe that there is
                a massive potential for digital medical devices in India. Ayu
                Devices is in talks with telemedicine centers which operate in
                remote areas such as Chhattisgarh's Sukma & Dantewada districts
                and Karnataka's Kolar district.

                Ayu Devices, which initially received a Biotechnology Ignition
                Grant of 5 million, is also eyeing private investors to raise
                fresh funds for expansion. SINE has invested 500,000 and has
                offered to spend a further 3 million for a more significant
                stake in the company. The startup is also working on a 'smarter'
                device that will use Artificial Intelligence to read patient
                data and collate necessary information for better diagnosis.

                The stethoscope is one such device which is a commonly used
                medical device in the healthcare industry. Adorned in the neck,
                it is the first recognition of a person as a doctor. Although it
                is a simple device, its efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis are
                determined by the person who uses it. The traditional
                stethoscope can only pick up clear sounds of the heart and
                lungs, making diagnosis quite difficult. Even the doctors find
                it tricky to spot an abnormality in the heart or the lungs using
                a conventional stethoscope. Also, it requires considerable
                training and concentration to identify the relevant sound
                patterns, especially in a noisy environment.

                The need of the hour was to invent a digital or electronic
                stethoscope to overcome the limitations of the traditional
                stethoscope and empower the medical community with a portable
                device and detect heart and lung sounds with accuracy. AyuLynk,
                phenomenal equipment by Ayu Devices is one such medical device
                which comes as an attachment to an existing stethoscope to make
                it digital and smart.
